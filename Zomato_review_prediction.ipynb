        "Zomato is India's largest platform for discovering restaurants and ordering food. It operates in India as well as a few cities internationally. Bangalore is one of the biggest customer and restaurant bases for zomato with 4 to 5 million users using the platform each month.\n",
        "\n",
        "Users on the platform can also post reviews of restaurants, and provide a rating accomapnying the review. The content in the reviews should ideally reflect the rating provided by the customer. In many cases, there is a mismatch, owning to multiple reasons where the rating does not match the customer review. The reviews and ratings matching is very important as it builds customer trust on the platform, and helps the user get an accurate picture of the restaurant.\n",

        "You, as a data scientist, need to enable the identification and cleanup of such cases, to ensure the ratings are reflective of the reviews and that the reviews seem trustworthy to the custimer. You will need to use NLP techniques in conjunction with Machine learning models to predict the rating from the review text\n",

A document is made up of words, each word is assigned a weight from 1 to 100 (where 1 is the most important and 100 means it has no importance in that particular context). Given this information, TfidfVectorizer will output a vector for each document in which the values correspond to these weights.\n",
